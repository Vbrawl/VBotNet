# VBotNet
This is a repo for a project called "VBotNet". A BotNet created for purely educational purposes

# Usage
There are 2 main starting points in for the program, there is the Listener and the BotNet (client).
For the botnet to be usable, for now, we need to start the listener, then start the client from a remote/virtual/local machine.

The listener is the starting point that allows us to send commands to our bots while the client is the receiver and parser of those commands.
